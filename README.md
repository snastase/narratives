This repository accompanies the public release of the "Narratives" data collection and the corresponding data descriptor paper currently in preparation. The "Narratives" collection comprises fMRI data collected while participants listened to 27 spoken story stimuli ranging from ~3 minutes to ~56 minutes for a total of ~4.6 hours of unique stimuli. The collection currently includes 345 unique subjects participating in a total of 891 functional scans with accompanying anatomical data. Data were collected over the course of roughly seven years, from October, 2011 to September, 2018. All participants provided informed, written consent prior to data collection in accordance with experimental procedures approved by Princeton University Institutional Review Board. This repository contains both scripts used to prepare the data for sharing (`staging/`) and scripts used to analyze the BIDS-formatted data (`code/`). Slides for a presentation of this dataset at SfN 2019 are available on [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KNViRGPHFf53PJLTM-1B1ZguHXSPWR2nppkLWNLSuy8/edit?usp=sharing). The raw BIDS-compliant data can be accessed via [**OpenNeuro**](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002345) and [**DataLad**](http://datasets.datalad.org/?dir=/labs/hasson/narratives).
